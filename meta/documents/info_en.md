Schuhe.de is an online platform for shoes, bags, and accessories that links online stores with stationary specialist shops. Shoppers not only have the possibility to order products online, but they can also find out which stationary shop has the item in stock and then reserve the item online with the Click&Collect function and afterwards collect it themselves in the shop. More than 4,000 stationary specialist shops are already represented on schuhe.de.
